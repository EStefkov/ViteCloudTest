          <h2>Chapter 1: The Encounter</h2>
          <p>
            Ivan adjusted his crooked glasses, his frail frame blending into the towering shelves of Kaufland’s snack aisle. His hunched posture betrayed his nerves as he scanned the various chocolate bars. He knew Ibrahim was nearby; he had seen him enter the store minutes ago, the man’s broad shoulders brushing past the automatic doors like a bear entering a cave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ivan’s heart thumped in his chest. He wasn’t sure if it was the excitement of potentially running into Ibrahim or the awkward possibility that his crush might actually talk to him.

          <h2>Chapter 2: The First Words</h2>
          <p>
            Ibrahim, on the other hand, was loitering by the bakery section, pretending to inspect croissants while stealing glances toward Ivan. His beard and hairy forearms seemed to make him larger than life against the backdrop of neatly stacked loaves of bread. Yet, for all his rugged masculinity, his thoughts were a jumble of uncertainty. Ivan’s delicate figure and shy mannerisms made his heart race in a way that left him both exhilarated and terrified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, fate, or perhaps sheer coincidence, intervened. Ivan turned the corner to grab a discounted bag of gummy bears just as Ibrahim stepped into the same aisle with a carton of eggs. Their eyes locked.

          <h2>Chapter 3: The Confession</h2>
          <p>
            “Oh! Hi, Ivan,” Ibrahim said, his deep voice cracking ever so slightly. He rubbed the back of his neck, his bicep flexing involuntarily as he shifted his weight. “Fancy meeting you here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ivan flushed crimson. “H-hi, Ibrahim. Yeah… uh… love a good sale.” He held up the gummy bears as if to justify his presence. His fingers trembled slightly, and the bag crinkled loudly in the silence that followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ibrahim chuckled, the sound low and warm. “Me too. You, uh, you like gummy bears?”

          <h2>Chapter 4: A New Beginning</h2>
          <p>
            Tentatively, Ibrahim reached out, his fingers brushing against Ivan’s trembling hand. Ivan glanced up, his heart pounding. Slowly, carefully, Ibrahim leaned down, his bearded face close enough that Ivan could feel the warmth radiating from him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is this okay?” Ibrahim whispered, his voice a low rumble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ivan nodded, his breath hitching. “Y-yeah.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Their lips met in a gentle, hesitant kiss, the world around them dissolving into a blur of fluorescent lights and the faint hum of the store’s air conditioning. Ibrahim’s hand cupped Ivan’s cheek, his thumb grazing the sharp angle of his jaw, while Ivan’s free hand lightly rested on Ibrahim’s solid forearm.
